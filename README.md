## BEM Methodology

BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) is a popular naming convention for classes in HTML and CSS, originally developed by Yandex. It is designed to create reusable, modular, and maintainable code.

### BEM Structure

BEM divides the user interface into independent blocks, which can be reused across different parts of the application. The naming convention follows a specific structure:

- **Block**: The top-level component or a standalone entity that is meaningful on its own.
  - Example: `header`, `container`, `menu`
- **Element**: A part of a block that performs a certain function and has no standalone meaning.
  - Example: `header__title`, `menu__item`
- **Modifier**: A flag on a block or an element that changes its appearance or behavior.
  - Example: `menu__item--active`, `header--large`

### Naming Convention

The BEM naming convention uses a double underscore (`__`) to separate elements from their block and a double hyphen (`--`) to separate modifiers from blocks or elements.

- **Block**: `block-name`
- **Element**: `block-name__element-name`
- **Modifier**: `block-name--modifier-name` or `block-name__element-name--modifier-name`

### Example

```html
<div class="menu">
  <ul class="menu__list">
    <li class="menu__item menu__item--active">Home</li>
    <li class="menu__item">About</li>
    <li class="menu__item">Contact</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

In this example:

- `menu` is the block.
- `menu__list` and `menu__item` are elements of the menu block.
- `menu__item--active` is a modifier that changes the appearance of the `menu__item` element.

### Benefits of BEM

1. **Clarity and Readability:** BEM makes it clear what each class refers to by looking at its name. It is easy to identify whether a class represents a block, an element, or a modifier.

2. **Modularity:** BEM promotes the creation of independent components. Each block is standalone, making it easier to reuse and maintain.

3. **Avoids Naming Conflicts:** The structured naming convention helps avoid class name conflicts, which are common in larger projects with many contributors.

4. **Improved Maintainability:** With BEM, the CSS and HTML structure is more organized, making it easier to understand, debug, and modify the code.

5. **Enhanced Scalability**: BEM's approach is particularly useful for large projects as it provides a consistent methodology for naming and structuring classes.

6. **Better Collaboration:** The clarity and structure provided by BEM make it easier for multiple developers to work on the same project without confusion.

### **Bugs**

### 1. Incorrect File Paths for CSS and Images

**Description:**  
When the project was first deployed, the links to the CSS files and images were not working. This issue did not occur in the local development environment but only after deployment.

<details>
<summary> Click to see images </summary>

![bug two](./assets/images/bug-two.webp)
![bug one](./assets/images/bug-one.webp)

</details>

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Deploy the project to a web server.
2. Attempt to load the web page.
3. Notice that the CSS styles and images do not load.

**Expected Behavior:**  
The web page should correctly load all CSS styles and images as it does in the local development environment.

**Actual Behavior:**  
The web page fails to load CSS styles and images, resulting in an unstyled page with broken image links.

**Cause:**  
The issue was caused by the use of absolute file paths for the CSS and image links, which worked locally but not in the deployed environment.

**Solution:**  
Replace absolute file paths with relative file paths in the HTML files. For example, change paths from `/path/to/file.css` to `./path/to/file.css` or `path/to/file.css`.

**Example:**

Before:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/style.css" />
<img src="/assets/images/cat-hero.webp" alt="yellow devon rex cat sitting" />
```

After:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/style.css" />
<img src="assets/images/cat-hero.webp" alt="yellow devon rex cat sitting" />
```

### 2. WAVE Image Not Appearing in README.md

**Description:**  
An image in the `README.md` file was not appearing because the file path was too long. This issue was resolved by shortening the file name.

<details>
<summary> Click to see image </summary>

![bug three](./assets/images/bug-three.webp)

</details>

**Cause:**  
The issue was caused by the file path being too long. Some Markdown parsers or rendering engines have limitations on the length of file paths they can handle. When the file path exceeds these limitations, the parser may fail to properly render the image, resulting in it not being displayed in the `README.md` file.

**Solution:**  
Shorten the file name to ensure the image appears correctly in the `README.md` file.

**Example:**

Before:

```markdown
![wave accessibility evaluation](./assets/images/wave-accessibility-evaluation.webp)
```

After:

```markdown
![wave accessibility evaluation](./assets/images/wave-accessibility.webp)
```
