        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          The Devon Rex breed originated from a natural mutation found among
          non-pedigree cats in Devon, England. Kirlee, born on July 15, 1959,
          emerged as the first Devon Rex, distinguished by his curly coat.
          Adopted by Miss Beryl Cox and Miss Margaret Croll of Buckfastleigh,
          Devon, Kirlee's uniqueness came to light when a newspaper article
          featured another curly-coated kitten, Du-Bu Lambtex, scheduled for
          exhibition at a prestigious cat show. Miss Cox reached out to the
          breeder, Mrs. Agnes Watts, revealing Kirlee's similar trait, thus
          initiating his recognition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially presumed to share the same mutation as the Cornish Rex due
          to their geographic proximity, further breeding experiments involving
          Kirlee and Cornish Rex variant queens disproved this assumption.
          Subsequent breeding efforts, albeit challenging due to limited
          breeding stock and reluctant breeders, revealed the Devon Rex as a
          distinct mutation. Despite their independent development, Devon Rex
          cats worldwide retain significant Cornish Rex ancestry, as evidenced
          by early breeding efforts aimed at establishing the breed. This unique
          lineage underscores the Devon Rex's singular position among feline
          mutations, with no other Rex mutation found compatible with its
          genetic makeup.

          <p>
            Devon Rex cats are ideal for keeping indoors, especially as their
            unusual fur will not protect them very well from the cold, wet and
            sunburn.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>

            alt="circled attention icon"
          />
          <p>
            Keep tabs on this cat because it tends to slip in tight, narrow
            places like behind your sofa or refrigerator.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <img src="assets/icons/play-icon.svg" alt="football ball icon" />
          <p>
            They are very playful and active cats. They therefore need space to
            romp around.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <img src="assets/icons/friends-icon.svg" alt="two cats icon" />
          <p>
            They get along very well with other cats, so you should give your
            Devon Rex a playmate.
          </p>

        <div>
          <img src="assets/icons/social-icon.svg" alt="two people icon" />

            Devon Rex cats love people and cannot stand being alone for long
            periods.

            Without suitable outlets for their high energies, they may resort to
            swinging like monkeys on drapes and blinds.
